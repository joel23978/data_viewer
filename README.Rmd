# data viewer

{data_viewer} is a Shiny App which enable you to view offical data from multiple sources, it also provides detailed breakdowns of Australian CPI data.

This project is a work in progress. 

The app currently allows you to pull data from FRED, dbnomics, the RBA (using read_rba) and bloomberg (assuming you have access to a terminal).


<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- You can install the development version of readAOFM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("joel23978/readAOFMpackage") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

What the app looks like:
```{r exampleChart1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics(here("doco", "example_1.png"))

```

We can (fairly trivially) make charts like the following:
```{r exampleChart2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("doco", "Australian CPI.png"))

```


and like this (using RBA data):
```{r exampleChart3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("doco", "Australian Dollar Exchange Rates.png"))

```


And the CPI-specific tab:
```{r exampleChart4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("doco", "example_3.png"))

```

Note: Items preceeded by an 'x' in the ui have not been implmented.
